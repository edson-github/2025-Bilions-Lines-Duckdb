### README: **ETL Pipeline - Processing 1 Billion Rows with DuckDB**  

---

### 🚀 **Project Description**  
This repository contains a practical example of an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline designed to process large datasets (up to 1 billion rows) using **DuckDB**, a high-performance OLAP database for batch processing. The main goal is to demonstrate how to build an efficient and scalable solution using modern technologies and data engineering best practices.

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

- **Python**  
- **DuckDB**  
- **PySpark** (for optional benchmarking)  
- **AWS S3** (optional, for data storage)  
- **Pandas**  
- **GitHub Actions** (for automation and CI/CD)  

---

### 📋 **Main Features**  

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Supports multiple file formats, such as **CSV**, **Parquet**, and **JSON**.  
2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Applies both simple and complex transformations with high efficiency.  
3. **Data Storage:**  
   - Stores transformed data in multiple destinations, including DuckDB, AWS S3, or local files.  
4. **Benchmarking:**  
   - Compares DuckDB performance with tools like Pandas and PySpark.  
5. **History Tracking:**  
   - Maintains version control of scripts and executed steps in the pipeline.

### 🚀 **How to Use**  

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Python 3.8 or higher installed.  
   - DuckDB installed (`pip install duckdb`).  
   - Install dependencies:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  

2. **Run the Pipeline**:  
   - Execute the main script with the following command:  
     ```bash
     python scripts/etl_pipeline.py --config config.yaml
     ```  

3. **Benchmarking**:  
   - Use the following command to run performance tests:  
     ```bash
     python scripts/benchmark.py
     ```  

---

### ✅ **Testing**  
Automated tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests:  
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

### 🌟 **Highlights**  

- Pipeline capable of processing **1 billion rows in under 30 seconds**, depending on the infrastructure.  
- Extensible solution for adding new transformations and integrations.  
- Practical performance comparison with other popular tools.
